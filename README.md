# Spotify Track Genre classification
This is the final project for the Machine Learning Class at the UPC Barcelona. The task is to find the optimal model in terms of accuracy (we also compared in terms of interpretability and computational cost) for the Spotify Dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/dataset-of-songs-in-spotify

# Structure of this Repo
In data you can find different preprocessed datasets which are obtained after running preprocessing.ipynb with the kaggle dataset. In the code folder you find the various models as jupyter noteboook. In the notebook you can see the results obtained and what code was used. For some model we produced pictures and saved them to include in our Overleaf report at https://www.overleaf.com/project/65d4d321d6536993493bcab2 The newewst version of the report will always be on the overleaf link but you also find a version as pdf from jun 01 in this repository.

# How to start

You need python, install the requirements and run the jupyter notebooks. We used Visual studio code and the python extension pack, the git extension pack and miniconda. You can download miniconda and create environments. We used Python 3.10.0
